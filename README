Visual Physics : The Physics Engine
-----------------------------------
Peter Hahn 

Overview: Visual Physics/Physics Engine is a free for-all, multipurpose project
using simple 2D graphics to act as a stress-reliever, a game, or an educational
tool. Currently, the most developed aspect of this engine is the Ball Factory.

Ball Factory
------------

The Ball Factory shoots out balls at varying x and y velocities, and the engine
shows their parabolic movement through space. Although the kinematics are simple
for this particular example, the Ball Factory is primarily used for stress
relieving. The user has the ability to control the color, size, velocity, and
acceleration of the objects flying around on the screen.

In addition, there is support to save a certain instance of use of the Ball
Factory. You can tap it to the sound of music, or to a rhythm of a beat, and
then load it up again next time you feel.

How to Use:
  1. Run the Engine Class, using java
  2. Use the different keys to control the balls
    - W: Increase the size of the balls
    - S: Decrease the size of the balls
    - Q: Changes the color of the balls
    - Space: Shoot out balls, while holding
  3. Use the mouse to move where the ball shoots out
  4. Upon closing, the program will save a text file with the instance of your
    ball game.
